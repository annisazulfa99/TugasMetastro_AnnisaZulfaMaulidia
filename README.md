### Deskripsi Project
[This is a Project schematic diagram for a motor shield compatible with Arduino Duemilanove or Diecimila. The motor shield supports the control of two DC motors or one stepper motor, with servo motor connections utilizing 16-bit PWM pins. The main components include the L293D H-bridge motor driver ICs (IC1 and IC2) for driving the motors, and a 74HC595N shift register (IC3) to extend I/O control. It also features capacitors (C1, C2, C7) for filtering and jumpers for configuration. This shield can control multiple motors simultaneously using the Arduino platform.]

### Fitur Utama
Dual Motor Control: It can drive two DC motors or one stepper motor simultaneously using L293D H-bridge drivers.
Servo Support: It supports two servo motors with 16-bit PWM pins.
Shift Register Expansion: The 74HC595N shift register allows for I/O pin extension.
Jumper Configurations: It has jumpers for flexible motor voltage selection and motor power.
Motor Protection: The design includes capacitors for noise reduction and protection.
